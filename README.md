# Solarflow Tools and Integrations

- [getting metrics into Homeassistant for automation purposes](controlling_with_homeassistant.md)
- [SolarFlow Control](solarflow-control/solarflow.py) a little python script that uses various telemetry data from smartmeter, micro-inverter and SolarFlow to precisely control energy-flow.
- [SolarFlow Statuspage](solarflow-statuspage): this is a little statuspage that is meant to replace the Zendure Mobile App. It provides a better live overview and some quick buttons to control output/charging limits.
